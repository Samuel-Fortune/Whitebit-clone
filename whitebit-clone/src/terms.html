                            <p>Trading with, Transactions, holding of Digital assets are related to significant risks. Prices may fluctuate on a daily basis. Such price fluctuations can increase or decrease the value of the User’s assets at any time. Any currency, whether virtual or not, can undergo significant fluctuations in value, as well as completely depreciate. There is an inherent risk of losses as a result of purchase, sale, or any trading in the market.

                            <p>Trading with Digital assets is also related to special risks that are not usually peculiar to Fiat money and/or goods and/or commodity (not virtual/digital) assets. Unlike most Fiat money guaranteed by governments, Digital assets are unique types of assets supported by technology and trust. There is no central bank that could issue more currency or take measures to protect the value of Digital assets in a crisis.

                            <p>Trading with Digital assets is often subject to irrational (or rational) “bubbles” or loss of confidence, which can lead to a drop in demand relative to supply. For example, confidence in Digital assets may fall due to unexpected changes imposed by software developers or other persons, government measures, creation of superior competing alternative Digital assets, as well as deflationary or inflationary spirals. Confidence can also be reduced due to technical problems: if the anonymity of the system is compromised, if assets are lost or stolen, or if hackers or governments can prevent any Transactions.
